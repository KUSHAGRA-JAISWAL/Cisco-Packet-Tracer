# Cisco Packet Tracer Training and Certification

## Description

This repository contains the documentation and resources related to my training and certification in Cisco Packet Tracer. It showcases my knowledge and skills in network topologies, routers, switches, and various algorithms and protocols used in networking.

## Topics Covered

### 1.Topologies: Designing network topologies including star, ring, mesh, and hybrid configurations.<br><br>
### 2.Access Deny: Implementing access control policies using access control lists (ACLs) for enhanced network security.<br><br>
### 3.ARP (Address Resolution Protocol): Understanding how ARP resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses for efficient communication within a network.<br><br>
### 4.NAT (Network Address Translation): Configuring IP address translation between private and public networks.<br><br>
### 5.DHCP Configuration: Automating IP address assignment, subnet mask, and default gateway using Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).<br><br>
### 6.Dynamic Network Address Translation (DNAT): Dynamically mapping public IP addresses to private IP addresses for secure communication.<br><br>
### 7.Dynamic RIP (Routing Information Protocol): Exchanging routing information and facilitating path selection across interconnected networks.<br><br>
### 8.FTP (File Transfer Protocol): Configuring FTP services for secure and reliable file transfers.<br><br>
### 9.OSPF (Open Shortest Path First): Implementing OSPF routing protocol for scalable and robust network architectures.<br><br>
### 10.Static Network Address Translation (SNAT): Configuring fixed mapping between private and public IP addresses for improved security and performance.<br><br>
### 11.Subnetting and Subnet Masking: Dividing networks into subnets to optimize address allocation and enable proper device communication.<br><br>
### 12.Switches and Hubs: Understanding the functionality and role of switches and hubs in network connectivity and performance.<br><br>
### 13.TCP and UDP: Differentiating between TCP and UDP, and their applications in network communication.<br><br>
